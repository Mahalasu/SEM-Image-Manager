# SEM-Image-Manager

---

This project is from my **undegraduation thesis**.

Here, we finish a hot stamping high-strength steel image database system, and users can use this database system for image management. In the future, it will also add function of microstructure recognition, similarity comparison, etc. The system can help scientific research institutions store and manage data, speed up search efficiency, and facilitate the research of scientific researchers.

Below are some screenshots of my software. Each of them represents the main window, image insertion, image modification, image search and image deletion.
